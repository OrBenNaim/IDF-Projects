## Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up the database:

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/OrBenNaim/Army-Training-Program/PostgreSQL-Projects.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd Online_Store_DB

3. Launch pgAdmin or your preferred PostgreSQL tool.

4. Follow the next steps to creating a new DB:

5. ### Click on the arrow next to 'Servers'

9. ### Click on the 'Open File' icon
![Step 5](screenShots/How_to_create_a_new_db/step5.png)

10. Go to the src folder and select the file createTables.sql for creating the necessary tables.

11. ### Click on the 'Execute script' button 
![Step 6](screenShots/How_to_create_a_new_db/step6.png)

12. Repeat on stages 8 and 9 and then selects the file 'insertData.sql' from the src folder.

13. Repeat on stage 11

14. Your DB is ready.
To see the data in tables itself, open the file 'showTables.sql' from the src folder (as you did in stages 8 and 9) and then run it (as you did in stages 8 and 11).


## Usage
1. Run Queries: Use the provided queries in queries.sql to perform tasks such as:
    - List orders by a specific customer.
    - Find out-of-stock products.
    - Calculate the total revenue.
    - Track orders by date.
2. Insert Data: Add new customers, products, and orders using custom INSERT statements.
3. Update Data: Modify existing records with UPDATE commands for scenarios like changing customer details or updating product prices.
4. Delete Data: Remove records using DELETE commands while maintaining referential integrity.


## Technologies Used
- PostgreSQL: Robust relational database system.
- pgAdmin: PostgreSQL management and administration GUI.
- VS Code: Used with PostgreSQL extensions for managing and querying the database.


## Future Improvements
- Advanced Search: Add advanced filters for products, such as by category or price range.
- Overdue Notifications: Integrate email notifications for new orders or inventory updates.
- Analytics: Generate reports on sales trends or customer purchasing behaviors.
